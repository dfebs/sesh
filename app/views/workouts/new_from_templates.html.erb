<h1>Exercise Templates</h1>
<p>This is the first step to setting up your exercises. Select from the fields below to add to your Exercises <%= render "icons/barbell" %> page.</p>
<p>All exercises on the Exercises <%= render "icons/barbell" %> page will then be used when you create sessions. Don't see a template here for an exercise you do? <%= link_to "Create your own exercise", new_workout_path %>.</p>
<p></p>
<%= render "workouts/template_form", templates: @templates %>
